Visualizations will be created using tools such as Tableau, Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn), or web-based platforms to ensure accessibility and interactivity. Key areas of focus include exploring the relationship between diabetes and factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographical location. The scope also includes identifying actionable insights to inform healthcare policies, public awareness campaigns, and targeted interventions aimed at reducing the burden of diabetes.\n",

        "The early diagnosis of diabetes is only possible by proper assessment of both common and less common sign symptoms, which could be found in different phases from disease initiation up to diagnosis. Data mining classification techniques have been well accepted by researchers for risk prediction model of the disease. To predict the likelihood of having diabetes requires a dataset, which contains the data of newly diabetic or would be diabetic patient. In this work, we have used such a dataset of 520 instances, which has been collected using direct questionnaires from the patients of Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh. We have analyzed the dataset with Naive Bayes Algorithm, Logistic Regression Algorithm, and Random Forest Algorithm and after applying tenfold Cross- Validation and Percentage Split evaluation techniques, Random forest has been found having best accuracy on this dataset. Finally, a commonly accessible, user-friendly tool for the end user to check the risk of having diabetes from assessing the symptoms and useful tips to control over the risk factors has been proposed.\n",
